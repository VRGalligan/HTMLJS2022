            Hello all! My name is Veronica Galligan. A lot of people actually call me Rosie! I am 24 years old and I am from West Warwick, Rhode Island.
        This is not my first time going to college. I graduated high school in 2015 and went to Wagner College for technical theater. I left after two 
        and a half semesters. While I didn't stay, that is where i discovered my love for art. I then started to work at Mohegan Sun in Conneticut 
        working inside of the arena. I met a lot of cool people and was able to witness so many amazing events. Once covid hit, there wasn't anymore 
        events to work so I decided to try something new. That is when I became a toddler teacher! This job was by far my favorite and most rewarding. 
        Working with two year olds taught me a lot, I met so many great kids and some very sweet parents. Working with them is what led me to know going to NEIT.

        While working with toddlers, I feel in love with childrens books, media, games, and the different ways children learn. I enjoyed working with them
        but I knew that it wasn't my calling. I started to see that there could be something I could pursue involving both my love for art and kids. I thought
        about childrens books, movies, games, and TV as well. This made me very excited and I started looking for schools to attend, which is when my Mom
        suggested I look at NEIT! When I saw the curriculum of the video game desgin program, I knew it was a good fit. Now I am hoping to learn new things, stay 
        diciplined, and increase my skill set.
